# 11A — Trace the watchface lifecycle

**Skill:** Algorithmic Thinking · **Estimate:** 30m · **Difficulty:** Low · **Priority:** High · **Prerequisites:** 10D, 2A

## Competency checkpoint

**Primary:** Algorithmic Thinking · **Supporting:** C Programming. Before implementation or diagramming, specify inputs, states, output changes and boundary conditions. After the activity, provide evidence for the stated completion criterion, explain the supporting competency in your own words, and self-score **both** using the [four-level rubric](../../curriculum/course-design/learning-outcomes-and-assessment.md). This checkpoint clarifies how the existing assignment is assessed; it does not add a new exercise.


**Companion reading:** [11A in the algorithmic thinking guide](../../curriculum/algorithmic-thinking/README.md). Distinguish direct calls from framework-triggered callbacks. Use this lesson's local starter; the reading is preparation, not a completed answer.

## Exact local example

- [`starter/`](./starter/) — One-text-layer Emery watchface; time only. It intentionally does not include a date.

Use the local example as a reference. Make your own decisions and retain the evidence requested by this lesson.

## Your task

Draw the execution flow for the time-only watchface. Include main(), init(), window_stack_push(), main_window_load(), update_time(), tick_handler(), app_event_loop(), main_window_unload(), and deinit() where applicable. Show which functions call other functions and which are callbacks. Show the separate path for a minute tick after startup.

## Completion evidence

A flow diagram shows startup, initial display, minute updates, and cleanup, with direct calls distinguished from callbacks.

## Build the starter

From the repository root:

```sh
cd lessons/11A/starter
pebble build
pebble install --emulator emery
pebble install --emulator gabbro
pebble logs --emulator emery
pebble logs --emulator gabbro
```

## Source and permissions

The complete required starter C source and build files are in this folder. Official Pebble SDK source copies are included only when their license authorizes redistribution, with the MIT license preserved. Other starter code is independently written for this course. Use **Emery and Gabbro** and follow the no-AI coursework rule.

## Dual-platform verification — Time 2 and Round 2

**Same activity, two displays:** [Pebble Time 2 / Emery](../../curriculum/dual-platform/README.md) uses a 200×228 rectangle; Pebble Round 2 / Gabbro uses a 260×260 circle. The existing learning outcome and competency rubric are unchanged. Any code you build should target both `emery` and `gabbro`, and you should check on both emulators for clipped text, invisible controls, and round-edge collisions. For non-coding work, account for both display geometries in your existing explanation/design—**this is not an additional assignment**.

Follow the [two-platform command and testing reference](../../curriculum/dual-platform/README.md). Compare actual results; a manifest listing two platforms is not evidence of successful compilation or physical sensor behavior. Round 2 touch is optional on watchapps; preserve button navigation and graceful touch-disabled behavior.
